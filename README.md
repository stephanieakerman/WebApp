# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repository for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

 *PROJECT BY: STEPHANIE AKERMAN*

 *Project Overview*
 **MBTA Station Finder" is a user-friendly web application aimed at simplifying the process of locating nearby MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) stations in the Greater Boston area. Developed using Flask, a Python web framework, the application provides users with instant access to information about the closest MBTA stations, along with their wheelchair accessibility status. By leveraging the MBTA API, users can effortlessly plan their travel routes and make informed decisions about their transportation needs.The application boasts an intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices. Error handling functionalities are implemented to provide informative feedback in case of invalid inputs or API errors, enhancing the reliability of the platform. With its focus on usability and accessibility, "MBTA Station Finder" aims to empower users to efficiently navigate the city's public transportation system, ultimately improving their urban commuting experience.**

*Reflection*
**Throughout the development of the "MBTA Station Finder" project, I encountered several highs and lows. One notable success was the successful integration of Flask and the utilization of APIs to retrieve location data and MBTA station information, enabling the creation of a functional web application. Implementing error handling mechanisms also proved beneficial, ensuring a smoother user experience by providing informative feedback in case of errors. However, the project scoping process could have been clearer initially. Ambiguity regarding the project's extent led to uncertainty about the features to include and the overall project goals, which could have streamlined the development process with clearer direction. In terms of task division, I initially planned to handle all aspects of development myself, focusing on both front-end and back-end components. However, as the project progressed, I realized the importance of effective time management even when working alone. Integrating different parts of the project required careful coordination and troubleshooting efforts, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and attention to detail. From a learning perspective, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in web development, API integration, and project management. It underscored the significance of clear project scoping, effective communication, and adaptability when working on solo projects. Additionally, leveraging ChatGPT's assistance throughout the development process was really helpful, AI helped me in debugging and problem-solving. There were challenges, the experience gained will contribute to future projects in software development.**
